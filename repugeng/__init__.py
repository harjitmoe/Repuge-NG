"""
Repuge-NG: Real educational/entertainment programs use game engines - Next Generation.

The original aim of REPUGE was to produce a framework in which an educational game
could be written in Python, as a response to an extracurricular challenge at School.
That project proved abortive, but I kept the codebase - both for the framework and
the project.

This project, Repuge-NG, was an aim to refactor the loosely functional REPUGE code,
where the meanings of x and y were not consistent across the API, into a tightly
object-oriented framework which allows programs to be written which are actually
readable.  This project has developed further, with the addition of multiplayer
support and with the multilevel paradigm being ironed out somewhat.
